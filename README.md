# Agriculture Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project is based on Indian agriculture data analysis, in which I will do in-depth data analysis, doing in-depth analysis of area coverage, seasonal trends, top states and districts. Its main goal is to extract patterns and insights that will help farmers and policymakers in decision-making.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains historical agricultural data, including:
- **State** â†’ Name of the state
- **District** â†’ Name of the district
- **Crop** â†’ Name of the crop
- **Season** â†’ Farming season (Kharif, Rabi, etc.)
- **Year** â†’ Year of production
- **Area** â†’ Land area used (in hectares)
- **Production** â†’ Total production (in metric tonnes)
- **Yield** â†’ Productivity (Production/Area)

## Data Cleaning & Preparation
The data underwent several preprocessing steps to ensure accuracy and consistency:
- Handling missing values and duplicates
- Removing outliers affecting the analysis

## Key Insights
- **Seasonal Impact:** The highest production is observed in `Uttar Pradesh`.
- **Top Crops:** The most cultivated crops include [Onions, Patato, Maize].
- **Best Performing Districts:** The highest-producing Districts are [Uttar Pradekh, Karnataka, Bihar].
